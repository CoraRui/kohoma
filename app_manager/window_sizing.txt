hrm.

I'm having trouble managing the window size and stuff.

so. theres the position of the CAMERA.

the position of the ORIGIN.

those are the main two reference points for things.

I guess I'll have to go through everything that needs to position itself in terms of those things and
find out how to write some sort of class to keep that information available.
buuuuut. everythings working right now! so its fine!
