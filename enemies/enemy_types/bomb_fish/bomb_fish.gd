#the entire thing from start to finish:

#fish jumps out of the water.
#fish gets boomeranged. itd be cool if the pot had optional
#boomerang/fishing hook compatibility
#the boomerang takes the fish to the player.
#the player then holds the fish on boomerang contact.
#at that point, the explosion timer starts.
#the fish will also explode if it touches an enemy when thrown/on the ground
#so i also need the boomerang to look/feel a bit better.
