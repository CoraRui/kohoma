#this script should control the bomb fish.
#its not going to do much. the fish itself just flops if on land undetonated.
#so on init it starts a timer until the timer runs out and it blows up.
#should it detonate if it hits an enemy?
#should use the pot node as well to facilitate picking it up.
#and should be grabbable by the boomerang/fishing rod.
#which should bring the fish to the player and cause them to hold it when it reaches them.
#that functionality should be an optional thing to add to the pot.
#for right now, the bomb fish should just explode after a certain duration
#should the player be able to walk on top of it?
#um. can the bomb fish literally just be a slightly modified bomb?
