This game is called kohoma. Its a Zelda nes clone that I'm using as a creative soundboard for various things. Hopefully it will allow me to:
	
	practice music composition
	practice managing a large project
	practice integrating new mechanics into that large project
	practice recreating old mechanics in that project
	understand game development a little better as a whole
