#this script doesn't do anything, I just want to put notes in it and todo notes.

#TODO: overall just look through it and add secrets/various interactions and stuff.

#BLUE: nice

#TODO: add more keys/mechanisms and secrets.
#TODO: add platformer room in 4-5 and figure out what to put in it.
#TODO: add story encounters within the dungeon, for that story you've totally written.
#TODO: some sort of animated wall ornament for dungeon one, it looks too static.
#TODO: make functional orbs with effects and make orb room work.
#TODO: animate enemies using tilesheets rather than individual sprites to expedite animation recoloring
#TODO: the entire bossfight.
