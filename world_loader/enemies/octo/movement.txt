so enemy movement.
what feels right? what am i going for with this one?
of those "main game" features, which do I want to use in this experimental project?
what themes will be preserved?
i think, at least for this little demo bit, I'm going to go with classic dungeon crawler.

get stronger, purify the evil, restore peace. classic.

so the monsters will be evil creatures. but also kind of cute.
i think the monsters, though created by ganon, might have a heart of gold.
but in the end, ganon has control. so you have to fight them anyways. but
i want there to be that little tug of like: "oh man, I wish we could just be buddies."
