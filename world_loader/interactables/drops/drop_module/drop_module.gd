#TODO: decide if you want to keep this and the simple drop thing separate
#TODO: add weighted randomized drops


#this script should contain a few possibilities for drops on death, and how to select which will be dropped. for now its just random.


#I think this was replaced by simple drop? but simple drop might specifically be for just normal guaranteed drops. anyways probably delete this later.
