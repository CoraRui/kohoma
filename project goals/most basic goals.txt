what is the actual base shit i have to do for this to be "finished"

boss battle

post boss scene
not sure exactly what that will be. there will be some "final thing". like when link holds up the triforce, fade to white.
then some text about what happens next. bam! KOHOMA
then, it goes back to title screen.
if you reload the file, there'll be somebody to vaguely explain that thats it for now, but you can go back and explore more
stuff that you missed if you want.


town rooms
overworld encounters/rooms
fix pause menu
save system
