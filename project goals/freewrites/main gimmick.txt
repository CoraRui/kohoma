I think all of the things in this are coming together, at least the more "normal" parts of it.
but it is lacking that one special thing that would help it stand out.
what other games had a trademark mechanic?

undertale was the rpg where you didn't have to hurt anyone.
albw was a 2d platformer where you could merge into walls.
lisa was an rpg maker game with extremely brutal theming
persona was an rpg where you could switch between different "powers", which
essentially allowed you to play as a bunch of different "characters". i don't think I'm
summing that up correctly. but whatever
hollow knight was. hm. i don't think it really had a special mechanic.
but all of the mechanics were really well done. and it was well-illustrated and 
composed and just extremely well-done overall. I wouldn't say there was much that was too mechanically
fresh about it. If i remember correctly, its biggest draw was that it was all hand drawn.
outer wilds was a mystery 3d platformer in a timeloop with seamless space travel in a completely simulated solar system
pizza tower had a really wacky illustration and musical style, and the dashing mechanic.
return of the obra dinn had its illustration style, and the level load system of "traveling through deaths"
portal had. portals...

anyways. while Im not gonna force myself to have a "killer mechanic", I think it could give some life to the game.
the purpose of this game is to more just polish my skills for making things like this in general. but, if I can make something 
cool while im at it, then that'd be really nice.
the mechanics I want to use in my more comprehensive game are the deteriorating file system, lots of unique story events to show
that, and maybe some more surface level mechanic.
anyways, I want to save the file system. for now, I want something simpler.
hmmmm.
