to do:
	clean up and recap code for overworld and dungeons
	create overworld map and dungeon one map
	more enemy types
	more landscape types?
	overall code cleanup
	


ok. so what am i thinking?

so all of the basic stuff is laid out. i can move between levels, level trees.

what should i add next?

level design? start populating the world with things, right?

box in the playable area
	yepm soon. its just to make the game playable.
	
some kind of map?
	thats not too important. i should eventually though.

start level design of the main overworld and dungeon
	i think this is it.

i mean whats the core fun? just exploring the world, the dungeons, and fighting bosses, right?
so thats the thing to work on.
hrm. well i want to do some code cleanup first, to be more efficient and to remind myself how my own systems
work lol.

what considerations should I keep in mind when designing levels?

	memorable land structure - patterns in the tilemaps that are distinct enough to recognize as "areas"
	fun enemy patterns - fun and possibly randomized ish patterns
	unique events - story events that take place in the world based on the current file
	discovery - having things to discover in the world
	
direction and "open world"
	
	ok. so theres an issue with the concept of "open world", right?
	the player can go anywhere. but you're only going to have "real content"
	in one spot. the solution to that is to probably limit things in general.
	hard limits a rock that requires the power glove, and soft limits like enemies that
	are more difficult to beat without a specific item.
	
	how to remedy that?
	
	ulrira - a hint booth to remind the player the next main objective
	path limiting - barring players from entering certain areas until a certain time.
	world map - some sort of map to help the player explore
