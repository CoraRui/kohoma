random things from zelda

enemy pattern change in certain places on certain story/event triggers
enemy behavior changes in response to different items/being attacked
varying enemy parameters on spawn
places of interest, shops, fairy fountains, etc.
map "disconnects" paths that don't connect with the rest of the map for a long time
spawn patterns connected to player position/item selection
enemy spawns after initial level load
attacks affecting inventory, file, things other than health
change drops based on player info, like no hearts when full health
enemy drop rate items, like heart up, or rupee up etc.

#random thoughts

reactions to "sound"
break a pot and an enemy will move, step on creaky tile etc.


I kind of want to figure out what parts of the enemy movement are reproducible, that way I can reuse what is, and only write unique code for what isn't.
