Saving
	for now, just save with the quit button, and go from your house every time.
	save your progress using save points
	when restarting the game, you will have (generally) two options of where to start:
		your home
		the last used save point
		(other minor points)
	saving at a save point will give you the ability to use that as your spawn point next time you load.
	there are also some points that allow you to spawn there occasionally, for instance some dungeons might allow
	you to spawn there just by arriving there.
