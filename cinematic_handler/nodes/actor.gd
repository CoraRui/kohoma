#I'm thinking that this would be the node that generally holds the characters that move during a cutscene
#should have animation. not sure how much i'll need here other than that. I mean, its just going to be moving around
#and playing animations and displaying dialogue. i don't think theres really much more. I may have been delaying this 
#thinking it was going to be much harder than reality...
