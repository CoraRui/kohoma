the mines. where fuzzy little creatures live.

oh, hello mister.

little fuzzy creatures pull on your pant leg.

what is this? cloth? doesn't taste good...

they collect mushrooms, lichen, nuts, etc.

mostly live in caves/dug tunnels, but go out into the forest too.

oh geez... they never invite me to play.

*yawn* I'll just wait here... until... they're back...

zzz...
