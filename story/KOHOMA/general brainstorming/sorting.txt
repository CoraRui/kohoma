everything will be sorted in their own categories however its best to sort them.
once I get down to the individual objects of focus, then their connections to other things will be outlined.
which is going to be complex and annoying... but thats the best its going to get with a folder structure.
I suppose I could program something to manage the data better. but that would be sort of overcomplicated and dumb.
