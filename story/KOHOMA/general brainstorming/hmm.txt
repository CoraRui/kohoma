i dunno how i felt about that. well obviously it feels nice.

its nice to be able to tell someone that you like them and stuff. 

not really in that way. but. just in the mutual nonromantic affection kind of way.

its just kinda warm and nice.

so should I do that?

doesn't seem like shes too busy today.

maybe I should ask. hrm. I don't think itd be too much of an overstep.

and if I go its not like I have to be super chatty anyways.

ugh. i sorta hate that i was so open about that now. but i still think its for the better.

again, lots of choices are static, and you have to choose one or another.

this way is better, even if a little cheesy.
