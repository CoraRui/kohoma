I'm not exactly sure why I'm feeling uncertain right now.

School? The game? My family? My own happiness? My "happy ending"? Making friends? The ocean?

I just want to make something that helps people. Something that can support people.

The best I can do in my own life is use my own experiences to make something that can find its way to someone like me, the way I was then.

The way I am now.

What do I need to do?
