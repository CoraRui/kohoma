its doesn't need to be a literary sense, but in as many ways as possible, I want to leave a sense of awe and questions behind.

I think a lot of that is going to come from having cool gameplay, music, art, characters. but I do also want there to be some narrative anchors for that feeling of mystery and wonder.

I think the wind fish did a good job of that in links awakening.

also a lot of the wonder in links awakening came from the music. it was just baked into the experience.

but it was well timed. there was adventure, then these cutaways to this mysterious stuff.

youd be fighting as normal, then the owl would incur some intrigue.

so I guess, as long as there are times like that, it should be ok.
