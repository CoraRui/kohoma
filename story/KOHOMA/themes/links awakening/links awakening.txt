ok. combine:

	dreamy atmosphere
	legend of zelda scrolling world mechanics
	
and you have something thats going to obviously resemble links awakening.
of course its going to resemble that. its already been done! its going to be a clone in a lot of ways.
i guess I should look for things that make it nice despite that.
knowing that the plot twist is going to be that its all a dream, knowing that the world is all fake.
the story should consider that. not just to "subvert" though. just to take advantage of that.
sure you knew that punch was coming. but does that make it any easier?
anyways. I think thats the stance I should take. try to be conscious of the fact that its a "replica", 
and try to have fun with the idea anyways.

what does that actually entail?
probably making the game a little shorter. 
dont lean too heavily on the actual narrative idea that its "all a dream", or how hard that "reveal" will hit.
just write everything as well as possible, have as many genuine experiences as possible.
 
have to wait a minute then. i guess.

urk.
