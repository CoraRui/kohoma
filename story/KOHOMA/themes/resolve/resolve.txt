Obviously i like undertales determination.

itd be nice to have a nice catchphrase/theme/main idea.

but its not really about the word obviously.

I just want to have an idea of what I want the player to be feeling.

obviously heroism is something close, but. not exactly.

its more about the courageousness. the "not giving up" thing.

although I think "courage" is an overused word

conviction is nice, but its a little serious.

the game is obviously about fighting. and the player will probably die. so I think that cycle of gameplay is

pretty good. like zero rangers "enlightenment" and endless cycle of life and death thing. although i still think that kind of thing is getting pretty tired by now.


but its nice to have lots of different takes on the same thing. I mean earthbound had a really weird respawn screen where ness turned to stone, and there was that
spotlight and everything. anyways the entire theme of the game doesn't have to be dependent on the reset system. it just needs to fit with the game.
could just do a whole bad dream thing. or some kind of literal. hmmm. as long as it doesn't come off as cheesy.

I think maybe the reason I'm stuck around the resets is cause thats where tension with the game is highest.
so it makes sense to think about the theming around the strongest moments. 

again, thats one of the most important parts, especially considering the "try again, and again. as many times as it takes." thing.

i don't think this is going to be the kind of game where i make it literal. but it should be considered.

"heart" is close. conviction is close. determination is close. faith. resolve resolution will. willpower? ugh.

I don't think any exact word is gonna fit unless the project is more complete.

but something like that.
