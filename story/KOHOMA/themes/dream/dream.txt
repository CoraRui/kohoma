The dream should be a somewhat lighthearted thing.

I just want that "unreal" feeling.

anyways, the two kids are in a shared dream because of some sort of nightmare demon that eats happiness or something.

so if they don't defeat him, he'll eat their friendship, and they'll wake up without any memory of the dream, and they wont be as close friends anymore

they aren't aware of the dream, neither are the inhabitants. alma and lief will probably learn of it around the end of the story.

the dream is supported by some macguffin thing. like defeat all the dream beasts and collect the mind crystals to fight the dream demon to wake up or whatever.
