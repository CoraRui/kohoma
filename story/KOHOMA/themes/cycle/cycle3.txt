I'm not exactly sure why I keep coming back to the cycle.

it just feels as if i need to know the overall flavor of the thing.

and the cycle feels very key to that.

but I guess thats more of a theming thing than a gameplay cycle thing.

in terms of theming, i guess id say.

nes? chiptune? the limited color pallette?

again the visual aspect will just require me to experiment a bit. although I know i dont want it to be too "serious"

id rather leave it a little brighter for happy/whimsical stuff.
