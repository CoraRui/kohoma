focusing on the theme being dream, id like to have the comforting moments feel a little bit surreal.

which is easier than you'd think in some ways cause leaving some things unfinished/undefined does that in a lot of ways.

as long as you don't use it as an excuse to leave details undone.

sort of a links awakening kind of deal.
