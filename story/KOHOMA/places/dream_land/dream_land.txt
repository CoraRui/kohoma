I wanted originally to not do an island to differentiate it from links awakening.
but... people are going to draw those similarities anyway. they'll probably guess. 
so I decided that I should just play into it.
don't rely on the reveal of "its all a dream"
have some other reveal, or tell some story that hits hard even if you know its coming.
 anyways, that all said.

its an island.

it makes a lot of sense. theres a disconnect from the rest of the world, a new landscape.
makes sense that you could fall asleep and end up there, a long way from home.
if you're on land somewhere, itd feel as if you could "get home"
but an uncharted island has that feeling of being inescapable, just like a dream.
i suppose the underground, undertale, is very similar.
or memory loss tropes in general. although, I think I should have a beach somewhere if this is really an island.
