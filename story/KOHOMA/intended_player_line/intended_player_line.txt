man. writings hard. lot like music. the creative freedom aspect at least. could write. anything! but nothings "right".

well ok. what are the actual goals for the beginning/ the story in general?

hmm.

well I want to have sort of a funny and weird theme going in the town.

and the actual first major plot point should be the direction to the first dungeon, or in the direction of that quest.

again, avoid pointless fetch quests. but also make the world interesting.

I guess thats the issue, right? i have this open world for the player to explore, but if I only give them one goal, then they'll just go

straight there and finish it.

I think I'll try it that way. I'll reveal the "main goal" *almost* immediately, allow the player to go straight there and finish the game.

the extra exploring will be largely optional. but whats the incentive?

I think I want to rely on intrigue. if the things I have to entertain the player aren't enought to make them question and be curious about the world,
then they probably won't enjoy the world anyways.

i mean, even if I tell them its "north", its not like they'll find it immediately, right?

I mean, with ANY game, whats the "point"? its just to throw as much in as you can.

new music, new characters to meet, new art, new challenges, enemies.

so, I guess what I want to draw from this is:

polish the MAIN LINE. 

initial overworld enemy patterns, initial cutscene, first dungeon, "end" event.

then, possibly allow for a completed state, where the next event that allows the player to proceed isn't there yet.

like oh theres an item at the shop which isn't in stock yet, which they need to move the rock which is in their path.

which will take. potentially months...
