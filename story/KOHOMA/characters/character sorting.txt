characters are primarily sorted by place.
it just seems like the most sensible thing that connects people.
and if i do more than one thing, some things will be repeated.
like, if I do a place, then a different place that encapsulates the same person twice, that'd be annoying.
I'm sure that'll happen even if I just focus on places. but I'd like to avoid it.
I'll try to keep characters in their "primary places". maybe I'll just put links/ references in more minor locations
