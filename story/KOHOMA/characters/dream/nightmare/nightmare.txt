antagonist that put the two in the dream to eat their friendship.

I kind of had an idea that the antagonist could end up being one of the main characters then he could "turn to evil" eventually.

then you have to beat him to save him/save your friendship.

which seems sort of cliche but I think its nice.

I think itd be fun if he was this grumpy gentle giant kind of character.

like he lives in the village with everybody, gets annoyed with them sometimes, but never really ends up doing anything about it
cause hes just nice.
