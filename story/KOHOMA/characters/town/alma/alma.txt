im thinking that the village is full of animals and weird creatures, and there are two, maybe a few more human (like) characters that are real.

anyways, how aware are alma and lief that its a dream? not at all?

and do i really want to go with that?

hmm. i don't mind it. as long as its not too overbearing on regurgitating the point of "oh but it was all a dream!!! how crazy is that what a plot twist etc etc."

its just meant to set the tone as a pleasant dream, and to be a little bittersweet when it ends.
