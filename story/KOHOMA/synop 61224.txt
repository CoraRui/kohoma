	Two children, alma and lief, share a dream because of the happiness/dream eater demon.

	the demon was attracted to them because of their good friendship	
	
	if they don't defeat him in the dream, he will eat their friendship, and they won't care for each other anymore.

	eventually they end up being buddies with the dream eater, cause the reason he eats friendship is basically some magic related curse for being lonely
