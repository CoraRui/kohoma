	The way that I will write story overall is by listing set information here, and more "brainstormy" stuff in other files.
	
	
	Two children, alma and lief, share a dream because of the happiness/dream eater demon.
	
	the demon was attracted to them because of their strong friendship, which contains lots of happiness for him to eat.
	
	if they don't defeat him in the dream, he will eat their friendship, and they won't care for each other anymore.
	
	eventually they end up being buddies with the dream eater, cause the reason he eats friendship is basically some magic related curse for being lonely
	
	which basically means that they save him by being buddies with him.
