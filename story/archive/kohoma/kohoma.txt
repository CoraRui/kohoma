ah, the peaceful kingdom of KOHOMA.

a butcher leads his livestock out to the grazing fields.
"hm? oh, good morning."

trees wave in the wind. the sound of leaves wash over the town.

a old farmer works in his fields.
he glances up at you, grunts, and keeps tilling. 

a couple of children run through town, waving a couple of sticks around.
they bump into you.
"oh, er, sorry mister." his eyes shift left and right, and he runs off.

a traveling trader rolls into town with his cart. probably heading to the general store.
