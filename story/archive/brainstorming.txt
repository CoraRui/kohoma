I started thinking about storywriting and creating content for Kohoma.
I want to have some sort of archive for things related to that.
That I can look at and get a feeling for the story.
which is kind of what this folder is, i think.
so when I kind of think: I want to make something that adds tone to this.
I should come here, and write about a person. or a place. or a thing. or a story idea.
but more importantly music. cause thats the substance of it I think.
Like I made that song to go with the intro dream, right?
That wasn't bad. and I think if I make things to pair with that, things will begin to come together.
anyways
